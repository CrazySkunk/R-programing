## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

### Value assignment
a <- 4
b <- 5
c=3
d=7
10 -> e
9 ->f
x <- a+b+c+d+e+f
a+b+c+d+e+f->k
z=a+b+c+d+e+f
print(c(x,z,k))
```
### all the above methods are viable when assigning variables
```{r}
### Vectors - This is a tabular representation of data
v <- TRUE
print(class(v)) # This prints logical as the data type
```
```{r}
v <- 25.7
print(class(v)) # this prints numerical since it is a numerical data 
# type all number forms in R are numerical except for integer which has its own type
```
```{r}
v <- 25L
print(class(v)) # this prints integer and this is how we denote integer in R
```
```{r}
v <- 2+5i
print(class(v)) # this print complex since it is a complex number
```
```{r}
v <- charToRaw("HELLO")
print(class(v)) # This prints raw since the string is converted to its raw literals
print(v) # prints 48 45 4c 4f
```
```{r}
### To create a vector we use the concatination/combine function
a <- c(1:10)
print(a) # Prints a single vector with one to ten or alternatively can be done as follows
```
```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0)
print(a)
```

```{r}
### Lists
## A list can contain vectors,functions or even other lists
## To make a list you use the list function
b <- list(c(1:10),sin,FALSE,list(c(20:100),TRUE))
print(b)
```

```{r}
### Matrix
## this is a multi-dimensional data type used to display data in tabular form
## Are created using the matrix() function
a <- matrix(c(1:50),nrow = 10,ncol=5,byrow=TRUE)
print(a)
```

```{r}
### Factor
## used to group object that are repeated in a concat function thus helping you understand
## and identify the various levels within a dataset
apple_colors <- c('green','green','red','green','yellow','green','red','green','yellow','red')
apple_factor <- factor(apple_colors)
print(apple_factor)
print(nlevels(apple_factor))
```

```{r}
### Data Frames
## Are tabular data objects that contain different models of data eg first column can be 
## numeric,second column can be logical and third column can be character
## All column need to be populated hence if an area is not populated u insert the NA to 
## indicate no value.
## it is creates using the function data.frame()
BMI <- data.frame(
  gender <- c('Male','Male','Female'),
  height <- c(152,171.5,165),
  weight <- c(81,93,78),
  age <- c(42,38,26)
)
print(BMI)

```
